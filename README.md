# ðŸ”¬ Bragg Angle Calculator

## ðŸ“– Overview
The **Bragg Angle Calculator** is a web application built using **Streamlit** to compute theoretical and experimental Bragg angles in **X-ray diffraction (XRD)** studies.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Compute Bragg angles** based on energy and lattice parameters.
- **Predict experimental Bragg angles** from measured reflections.
- **Visualize diffraction data** with plots.
- **Download computed results** for further study.

## ðŸš€ Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abd_zak/braggcalculator.git
